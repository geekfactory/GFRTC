# Geek Factory GFRTC Library #

This is a library to read / write time and date information when using the very popular __DS1307__, __DS3231__ & __DS3232__ RTC chips from Dallas/maxim.

The library can provide time in standard structures or as a unix timestamp to cover a wide range of applications. Examples provide enough information to get started and the API is fully documented on the GFRTC.h file.

## Basic library usage ##

## Project objectives ##

* Create a library that supports common RTC chips, including DS1307 & DS3231.
* Access full functionality of the targetted RTC chips.
* The library should provide support for setting / getting time on unix format.

## Supported devices ##

The library has been tested on the following hardware:

* Arduino UNO
* Arduino MEGA
* Arduino MKR1000
